	doi = {10.1126/science.aaa6516},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Policy-makers often commission formal analyses to estimate the costs, risks, and benefits of proposed projects or policies. Applications range from estimating the risks of commercial nuclear power, to setting priorities among environmental risks, to comparing technologies for generating electricity, to weighing the benefits and risks of prescription drugs. In the United States, analyses are required for all major federal regulations. Fischhoff reviews how such analyses are limited by the scientific and ethical judgments inherent in the process and require collaboration between those who generate the analyses and those who want to use them.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
