	issn = {0027-8424},
	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1116437108},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100–110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ -C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching ∼3 Gt y $^{\textrm{−1}}$ and N use ∼250 Mt y $^{\textrm{−1}}$ by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only ∼0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of ∼1 Gt y $^{\textrm{−1}}$ , and global N use of ∼225 Mt y $^{\textrm{−1}}$ . Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.0708013104},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} From a global viewpoint, a number of challenges need to be met for sustainable rice production: ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}i{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) increasingly severe occurrence of insects and diseases and indiscriminate pesticide applications; ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}ii{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) high pressure for yield increase and overuse of fertilizers; ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}iii{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) water shortage and increasingly frequent occurrence of drought; and ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}iv{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) extensive cultivation in marginal lands. A combination of approaches based on the recent advances in genomic research has been formulated to address these challenges, with the long-term goal to develop rice cultivars referred to as Green Super Rice. On the premise of continued yield increase and quality improvement, Green Super Rice should possess resistances to multiple insects and diseases, high nutrient efficiency, and drought resistance, promising to greatly reduce the consumption of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and water. Large efforts have been focused on identifying germplasms and discovering genes for resistance to diseases and insects, N- and P-use efficiency, drought resistance, grain quality, and yield. The approaches adopted include screening of germplasm collections and mutant libraries, gene discovery and identification, microarray analysis of differentially regulated genes under stressed conditions, and functional test of candidate genes by transgenic analysis. Genes for almost all of the traits have now been isolated in a global perspective and are gradually incorporated into genetic backgrounds of elite cultivars by molecular marker-assisted selection or transformation. It is anticipated that such strategies and efforts would eventually lead to the development of Green Super Rice. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
